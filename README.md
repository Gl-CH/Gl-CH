                  
Hi there! I'm a **Computer Science student and Python Developer** passionate about software development, game design. I'm constantly honing my skills and working on projects that blend creativity with technical expertise.

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ **Computer Science student** focused on low-level systems and embedded software development.
- ðŸ’» Proficient in **Python**, and **GDScript**,
- ðŸŽ® Game developer working on innovative projects like **ULTRAVIOLENT**, a fast-paced Boomer shooter with unique mechanics.

## Skills

- **Languages**: Python, Gdscript
- **Technologies**: Godot Engine (4.x), Git,
- **Focus Areas**: Game development, software development, low-level programming

## Projects

### ðŸŽ® ULTRAVIOLENT
A fast-paced first-person shooter that emphasizes improvisational combat and environmental interaction. Players must scavenge weapons and use physics-based gameplay to survive in chaotic environments.

- **Tech Stack**: Godot Engine (GDScript), momentum-based traversal mechanics.
- **Features**: Dynamic combat, weapon scavenging, dash/slide mechanics.

### ðŸ’° Pefi â€“ Personal Finance Tracker
A finance management app designed to help users log daily expenses and keep track of their finances over time.

- **Tech Stack**: Python
- **Features**: Daily expense logging, budgeting tools.

## What I'm Currently Learning
- Learning C++ so i can fork the godot engine
